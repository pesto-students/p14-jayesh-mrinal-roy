    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?

        Are you - Nobody - Too?
        
        <p>Then there's a pair of us!
        
        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>
        
        How dreary - to be - Somebody!</p>
    <p>How public - like a Frog -

        To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!</p>
